The html file in this repo has been adjusted for clarity

    -css style sheet re-written from scratch 
    -reformatted into grid
    -overdone blue palette swapped for modern dope one
    -meta tags and header updated with descriptive, SEO friendly titles
    

**many changes were made to the stylesheet while using a browser that was magnified to 22% unbeknownst to the programmer. As a result, there's some extra gray space between divs. It will have to be fixed at another time**
