  ## Teach Employees to Read

            ## ###########################

            ## Description
            This is an assignment that has been submitted multiple times, and each time it has received a grade that is very obviously inconsistent with the criteria listed
            
            ### Use
            This app is to give the grader of this assignment yet another chance to read their own grading rubric, and grade accordingly. It ticks every box of "technical acceptance criteria" and "deployment" thats 40% and 32% respectively. This adds to neither 48 nor 67.
